        <p>This website is the 1<sup>st</sup> project in the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. The projects listed here don't exist at the moment.</p>

      <section class="features">
        <h2>Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bootstrap</strong><br>
              The layout is based on the Bootstrap (current version 4.0.0-alpha.6) grid system. Some class names are used for description or for future modifications. Not all of them are therefore present in the styles.css file.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Icons</strong><br>
              <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> is used for all icons, including input group addons in the contact form.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contact form</strong><br>
              The contact form is inspired by the front page example at <a href="https://bettercontactform.com/">Better Contact Form</a>, but the code is mine.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="not-work">
        <h2>What doesn't work</h2>
        <p>As I am building this website <em>before</em> moving on to learning JavaScript, only HTML and CSS are used here. Therefore some features don't work yet.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contact form</strong><br>
            The Send button should send me an email with the subject, name, message and attachment provided by the sender. It currently doesn't do anything.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Search</strong><br>
            The search form in the navbar should allow the user to filter projects based on desired technology, tools or keywords.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Red buttons in modals</strong><br>
            Buttons in the Technologies and Tools section in modals should work the same way as the search form and provide a list of projects in which similar technologies are used.
          </li>
        </ul>
